>#### Description:
Pre-written Batch/.bat script to kill the Spotify process tree on Windows. (Linux + MacOS are unaffected.)

Pre-compiled .exe executable file included in [Releases](https://github.com/Defirence/shitify-windows/releases) or a [Direct Link for the latest release](https://github.com/Defirence/shitify-windows/releases/download/0.0.1/shitify-win-v0.0.1.exe)

>#### Usage:
Run the `.bat` or `.exe` file normally whenever Spotify crashes, or won't re-open/close.

>#### Why:
Due to a bug in the recent update, mostly affects Windows + Client version:

`Spotify for Windows 1.1.94.870.gf994cb0b`

They have a [Forum thread](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Desktop-app-crashing-on-Windows-after-latest-update/idc-p/5431510), if you are affected and can report it on that thread it'll help.

> #### Releases:
The .bat script and a pre-compiled .exe file are under the [Releases](https://github.com/Defirence/shitify-windows/releases) column to the right otherwise you can always 
build from source.
